My lecture notes.


The format .odt is choosen on request, and it helps
most patch the documents.

.odt files are written in LibreOffice (OpenOffice.org
also works) and is free and is unarguably the best
graphical document writter for this purpose.

.svg files are drawn in Inkscape.


Your are allowed to redistribute my notes, but it is
always best to refer to this web page as it will help
the receivees get up to date versions.
From now on, please also be careful not to distribute
on sites where it may lead to spam; as it has led to
my first (and only [just one]) spam mail being sent
to my primary e-mail address.
